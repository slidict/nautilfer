### Resolving UID Mismatch Between Docker and Host

To resolve issues related to the difference between Docker's UID and the host's UID, add the following line to your .bashrc or similar shell configuration file:

```bash
export UID=${UID}
```

This will ensure that the environment variable UID is correctly set in your Docker containers, matching your host system's user ID.

This explanation provides clear instructions on how to resolve the UID mismatch issue using the export command.

## Usage

```ruby
require 'nautilfer'
```

```ruby
Nautilfer.to_teams(message: "## TEST\nhello", endpoint: "#{workflow_endpoint}")
```
